  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Turmeric milk is a great home remedy for cough, congestion, colds, and skin problems. This winter, replace your usual hot cocoa with an invigorating cup of wellness — bonus points for jammies and slippers. Turmeric can stain clothing and countertops, so wear an apron and proceed with caution.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric, or to taste</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 pinch ground ginger</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>

    <li>Whisk together turmeric, cardamom, black pepper, ginger, cloves, and allspice in a small bowl; set aside.</li>

    <li>Heat milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes; stir honey and vanilla into milk until completely dissolved.</li>
    
    <li>Whisk 1 teaspoon turmeric mixture into milk mixture; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors blend, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour mixture through a strainer.</li>
