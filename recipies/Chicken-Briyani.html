  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.
  </p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided  </li>
    <li>2 large onions, finely chopped </li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.    </li>


    <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>

 
    <li>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</li>

    

    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices. </li>
